## WeatherPy
I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. This data was captured by utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API.

## VactionPy
I created a Python script to visualize hotel locations with my ideal weather for a vacation. This data was captured by utilzing the Geoapify API.
